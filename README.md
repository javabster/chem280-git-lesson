# git lesson
This lesson covers the basics of git for version control.

This lesson is for the first day of the MSSE bootcamp (Chem280).

To make a commit (a "version" or "checkpoint") of your files, follow this procedure:
1. Make changes to your project that you would like to keep.
2. When you have your changes, tel `git` you are ready to create a checkpoint of the file using the `git add FILENAM` command.
3. Create a checkpoint of your file using the `git commit -m "Message about what you did".
